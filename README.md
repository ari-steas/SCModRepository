**Starcore** is a community built around modding space engineers, usually for PVP scenarios.

In StarCore, teams build their own ships and battle for the spot of champion in a StarCore Tournament. They normally take place on Saturdays and are streamed live by one of several streamers over on Twitch (See #content-announcements in the StarCore Discord for more information).  It's time to join the arena!


## Contribution guide

### prerequsites:
- (extremely recommended) github Desktop, GitExtentions, or something similar
- knowing the layout of SE mod files
- enough space to download the entire git repo (~5gb)?

### Step 1:
- ``Fork`` this repository to a folder on your computer. Name it something like SCModRepository-Yourname. This is where your edits can be made, and is apparently how actual projects do it. You can do this in GitHub desktop by git cloning the url, or through the github website, with the "fork" button which you can then git clone to a folder on your computer where you can make changes.

### Step 2:
- ``Make a branch`` for the changes you want to do on ``your local repository``. (i.e. SCModRepository-Yourname/BuffMyFavoriteGunPlease) Use your local repository's ``Main`` branch to keep in sync with starcore's ``Main`` branch, it makes edits much easier. You just click the button on github to sync it.

### Step 3:
- To test your changes ingame, Copy the mod you want to edit to your ``%Appdata%/SpaceEngineers/Mods`` folder.
 
### Step 4:
- Make your edits and throw it back in the repository folder. you can use the ``.bat file`` included in the repository to link your local Space Engineers mods with the ones in the repository.

### Step 5:
- Submit a pull request so that the branch can be merged into the SCModRepository/master one.






## How does this work?
The repository contains a .github folder, Space Engineers mod folders, and a .gitignore file.
### .github folder:
- contains the instructions to the bot what to do after a "push", currently set to upload to the steam workshop after the respective .yml file detects a change in the folder its looking for
### SE Mod folders:
- contains all the data that would load normally as an SE mod
### .gitignore file
- tells git what to exclude during a push (like .sln files in visual studio)
