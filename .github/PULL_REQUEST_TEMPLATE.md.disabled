### ADDING A NEW MOD

- First, the mod needs to be uploaded ingame once so a steamworkshop link is set.
- Then add https://steamcommunity.com/id/starcoretv/  as a friend and contributor to the mod. 
- Make a PR and the UniversalUpload workflow by Aristeas should push it to the repository.


### UPDATING AN EXISTING MOD
- List changes made.
